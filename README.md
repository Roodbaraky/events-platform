## Summary

## Test Accounts
The password for all test accounts is:
```
test123
```

Users:
```
testuser@test.com
testuser2@test.com

```

Admins:
```
testadmin@test.com
testadmin2@test.com

```

You are also welcome to create your own account to test, but note that it will only be granted user privileges and so, only able to sign up and add events to calendar.

This is also limited to a small quota of signups due to using a free tier SMTP service, so sometimes signup is unavailable.
